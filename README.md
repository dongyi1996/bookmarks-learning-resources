# **Learning Resources**

**Bookmarks on learning Remote Sensing, R/Python, ML/DL and related topics**

These are the resources I have gone through and found very helpful in learning.

notations:

-   YT: youtube video link

-   Github: Github Repo link

-   article: research articles

## R/Python

## Remote Sensing:

Best content to jump:

-   YT: [Introduction to Remote Sensing with Python](https://youtu.be/gi4UdFsayoM) [[GitHub - yohman/workshop-remote-sensing](https://github.com/yohman/workshop-remote-sensing)]

## ML/DL

mostly with satellite imagery

-   YT: [Deep Learning for Remote Sensing images with R language](https://youtu.be/N3CHgRlRqOA) [[GitHub - ricds/DL_RS_GEE](https://github.com/ricds/DL_RS_GEE)]
